# phagocyticSpreading
This code is updated to run from a MATLAB App - SpreadGUI_App.mlapp. The whole app can be installed using the uploaded installer - phagocyticSpreading.mlappinstall

It is supported by many different functions. The main function to solve for spreading over time is spreadCellCalcFEM_new.mat.

All files in this release need to be included in the MATLAB path to run the code.

Any questions should be directed to me at emmet.a.francis@gmail.com.
